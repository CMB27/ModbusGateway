# ModbusGateway
A library for the Arduino platform to connect Modbus TCP client devices to Modbus RTU slave/server devices.

This is very much a work in progress at this point.

I am developing this on the [Arduino Nano ESP32](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nano-esp32) with a [Nano2UNO Adapter 3V3](https://github.com/CMB27/Nano2UNO-Adapter-3V3) and a [ModbusRTU Test Shield](https://github.com/CMB27/ModbusRTU-Test-Shield).
